> Most useful recipes are : Skill Books Combinaison (to create hybrid spellbooks), ArrowHead + Honey = Charming ArrowHead, Eternal Artefact + Armor = enhanced armor stats, Rune Frames + Runes = Runes with additionnal stats, you can combine runes to create more powerful ones, Life essence + Water Essence + Scroll = Scroll of ressurection. (I may have forgotten some recipes, but you can finish the game even w/o the ones I mentionned, in all difficulties)
